// This is a typical code template for competitive programming in C++

#include <bits/stdc++.h> // "#include" is a feature of the g++ compiler, and in this case, it is used to include the entire standard library, just simplicity sake for the programmer

using namespace std; // "using namespace std" allows classes and functions from the standard library to be used directly in the code; it just saves some time for the programmer
                     // Without this line, we would have to write "std::cout", but with this line, we can just write "cout"

int main() // Competitive programming does not usually require OOP, thus most of the code is implemented in the main function
{ 
    ios::sync_with_stdio(0); // same as sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr); // unties cin with cout
    cout.tie(nullptr);
    // solution 

    return 0; //  this line is only necessary for C programs, but including it in C++ doesn't harm the program
}


// To compile a C++ Program, just open the terminal at the path of the file, and enter
// "g++ <name of the file>.cpp"
// To run the program, enter
// "./a.exe" (windows) or "./a.out" (linux) depending on the system you're using

# Introduction
Competitive programming combines the **design of algorithms** and the **implementation of algorithms**

## The design of algorithms
Analyzing problems & creative problem solving; and algorithms should be correct and efficient
- mathematical & creative thinking
- combination of theoretical knowledge

## The implementation of algorithms
Applying theoretical algorithms through code; not only does the theoritical portion be correct, but the implementation must also be efficient and correct

# Programming Languages
Most popular languages used in contests:
- C++
- Java
- Python

C++ often considered as the best choice for competitive3 programming
- nearly always available in contest systems
- efficient high-capacity language
- standard library contains numerous data structures and algorithms
Choice of programming language can still depend on preference, as python and java are still good options, but C++ will be the main language of this repository

# Input and Output
In most contests standard streams are used for input/ouput
- In C++: use 'cin' for input and 'cout' for output
- For C: 'scanf' and 'printf' can also be used
    - This is applicable for both C++ and C

# Competitive Programming Guide
A comprehensive guide based off of the Competitive Programmer's Handbook by Antti Laaksonen. This repository will throroughly run through the particulars of competitive programming, under the assumption that you have knowledge for the basics of progarmmming, but not much experience with compeitive programming.
- This repository will mainly contain my personal notes and important information from the handbook
- Most programs and code in this repository will be written in C++11, the same concepts should still apply for other languages though
- The handbook can be found at https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf

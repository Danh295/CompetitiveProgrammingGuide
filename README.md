# Competitive Programming Guide

***IMPORTANT:***
I'm using a proper note taking platform for my own learning as well, and for the sake of time I haven't updated this guide often. This repository will still be in the works but expect to see slower and later updates

A comprehensive guide based off of the Competitive Programmer's Handbook by Antti Laaksonen. This repository will throroughly run through the particulars of competitive programming
- This guide is completed under the assumption that you have knowledge for the basics of progarmming, and in C++, but not much experience with compeitive programming
  - There is a focus on algorithms and data structures
- This repository will mainly contain my personal notes and important information from the handbook
- The handbook can be found at https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf

## Language: C++
While most code and programs in this repository will be written in C++, logic of algorithms and data structures are still applicable to other languages
